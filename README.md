## Project 1: 15-Puzzle
### Authors: Jaeha Huh, Chris Gao

Program language : Python (jupyter Notebook)

**Description:**

On a 4 x 4 board there are 15 tiles numbered from 1 to 15 and a blank position. A tile can slide into the blank position if it is horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent to the blank position. Given a start board configuration and a goal board configuration, find a sequence of moves to reach the goal configuration from the start configuration. The goal is to find a solution with minimum number of moves.

To solve 15 puzzle problems using Python, we implement the A* search algorithm with graph search.
